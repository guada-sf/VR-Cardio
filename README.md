The project's primary objective was to design a simulator for the placement of electrodes for an electrocardiogram (ECG). This simulator is intended to provide a platform for medical students and recent graduates, as well as individuals in related fields, to practice the technique of electrode placement. The aim is to reduce the likelihood of errors in a real-life clinical setting.

While improper ECG electrode placement may not directly jeopardize a patient's life, obtaining a high-quality ECG is crucial for an accurate diagnosis by medical professionals. It plays a vital role in determining the appropriate treatment for the patient.

This project serves as a valuable training tool to ensure that medical practitioners can consistently perform ECG procedures with precision, enhancing the overall quality of patient care and medical diagnosis.

## Usage Mode

The participant will find themselves inside a shock room, facing a patient lying on a stretcher. They will then receive a brief introduction to the ECG technique through a video displayed on the screen mounted on the wall. During this initial stage, we simply expect the participant to listen attentively to the information presented.

Following that, a virtual mentor will provide guidance, directing the participant through the necessary steps for correct usage. The participant will receive both audio and visual feedback to continuously assess their performance.
